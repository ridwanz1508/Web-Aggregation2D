Crafting a Python desktop web application with a primary function of scanning QR codes or barcodes, it seamlessly integrates the scanning capability to capture data. This data is then securely stored within an SQLite database. Additionally, the application performs essential data aggregation processes to derive meaningful insights.

Upon initiation, the application provides a user-friendly interface allowing users to effortlessly scan QR codes or barcodes. The scanned data is promptly saved into the SQLite database, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

Furthermore, leveraging the power of Flask, a robust Python web framework, the application presents a dynamic web interface. Users can conveniently access and interact with the scanned data, facilitating streamlined operations and decision-making.

Whether it's for testing (Uji) purposes or training (Training) sessions, this versatile application caters to diverse needs, offering a seamless experience for managing and analyzing scanned data
